                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Soteria consists of three major components:
                    <ol>
                        <li>the <strong>project website</strong></li>
                        <li>the <strong>sensor network</strong></li>
                        <li>the <strong>virtual reality demo</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sensor network is written in Rust, and can be located
                    in the <a href="https://github.com/poe-iit/poe-core">poe-core</a>
                    repository. It handles the communication of nodes with
                    each other, over TCP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project website is what you are currently viewing. It
                    serves multiple purposes: a way to promote and desrcibe
                    Soteria and as a primary repository for project documentation.
                    The source code can be located in the
                    <a href="https://github.com/poe-iit/poe-website">poe-website</a>
                    repository.

                        <em>
                            Please update it frequently, or at least at the
                            end of every semester.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The virtual reality demo is exactly that, a demo written
                    in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. The source
                    code is located in the

                <p>
                    Since all projects use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
                    for version control, we describe below how to best set
                    that up for all IPRO members.
                </p>

                    <h4>Git Setup</h4>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a version
                        control system that runs "locally"
                        on one's personal computer. GitHub is website
                        that hosts repositories "remotely" on their servers.
                        <br>
                        Together, they can be used to share/modify/download
                        code repositories in a way that facilitates collaboration.
                        There are many resources available for learning Git
                        for any new members, such as
                        <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">ProGit</a>.

                                                    Check by running <code>git --version</code> in Bash or Powershell.

                <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>
                    The <a href="/">Soteria website</a> has three primary pages
                    <ol>
                        <li>the <strong><a href="/index.html">Home</a></strong> page</li>
                        <li>the <strong><a href="/people.html">People</a></strong> page</li>
                        <li>the <strong><a href="/demo.html">Demo</a></strong> page</li>
                        <li>the <strong><a href="/wiki.html">Wiki</a></strong> page</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Home</strong> page is where we present the
                    Problem statement and introduce Soteria.
                    This page is largely static as the goals
                    of the project remain unchanged. Work with the Marketing team
                    (if there is one) so that a consistent design/theme is kept
                    and the information listed is correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>People</strong> page is where past and present
                    members receive credit where it is due. There should be a catch-all
                    <strong>Past Contributors</strong> section for non-current
                    IPRO members. The current members should be listed under
                    their appropriate subteams above. This project has passed
                    many hands, and even you will end up on the list of contributors
                    who made Soteria possible.

                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of the semester, you should move the previous
                    semester's members down to the <strong>Past Contributors</strong>
                    section, and add yourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Demo</strong> page is where the virtual reality
                    subteam gets to showcase their hard work. The VR demo is a
                    proof of concept that will allow new people to understand
                    what Soteria will be capable of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Wiki</strong> page is ideally the culmination of
                    all project documentation. At the time of this website's inception,
                    the project documents lie in a Google Drive which can be unwieldy.
                    Though it takes some effort to add information and figures here,
                    it is worth it for easier access. Anybody reading this is
                    already gaining from it by reading the above steps to set up
                    development workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the website is largely static, we do not use a backend
                    such as PHP or Node/Express.js. We do use
                    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap v5.0</a> and
                    its associated classes and JavaScript. There are four HTML
                    files: <code>index.html</code>, <code>people.html</code>,
                    <code>demo.html</code>, and <code>wiki.html</code>. These
                    have their respective CSS files, while site-wide styling is
                    located in <code>styles.css</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are allowed to make any changes you want, Soteria is in
                    your hands after all. But we urge you to collaborate with
                    each other and keep future students in mind. As long as you
                    stay consistent with details that span the entire site
                    (color scheme, fonts, layout, etc.,), then the website will
                    only improve.

                <h3>Core Codebase</h3>
                <p>
                    The core codebase refers to the software portion of the actual
                    network of sensors that make up Soteria. Put simply, Soteria
                    consists of sensors/nodes scattered throughout a building.
                    These nodes communicate with each other in case of an emergency,
                    and will intelligently route building inhabitants to safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can conceptually divide this core code base into three
                    components:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            the front-end user interface
                            (<a href="https://github.com/poe-iit/poe-crust">poe-crust</a>)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the back-end web server
                            (<a href="https://github.com/poe-iit/poe-mantle">poe-mantle</a>)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the underlying node network
                            (<a href="https://github.com/poe-iit/poe-core">poe-core</a>)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
